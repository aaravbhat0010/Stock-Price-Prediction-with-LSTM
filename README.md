# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM-
Developed a stock price prediction tool using a neural network (LSTM) to forecast future prices based on historical data. Users can input any publicly traded stock, view real-time prices via the yfinance API, and simulate future market trends. The system predicts next-day and N-day prices, helping users explore buy/sell strategies. This project combines machine learning, finance, and data visualization â€” perfect for demonstrating predictive modeling, API integration, and user interaction in Python.
